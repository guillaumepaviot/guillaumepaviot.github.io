I'm Guillaume Paviot, a data scientist with a Masterâ€™s degree in Data Science from the Technological University of Berlin and an engineering degree from IMT Atlantique in Nantes. I have a passion for exploring the world with my friends and staying updated on new technologies.

I am particularly interested in how data science can enhance our understanding of the environment we live in and improve our interactions with it.
