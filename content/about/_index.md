I'm a data scientist, focused on environmental science and the use of data in the field. I studied engineering and environmental science at IMT Atlantique in Nantes, France, and computer science at TU Berlin in Germany.

I've always been passionate about computer science and the environment. While working on some side projects like video games or twitter events, I've had the opportunity to apply my skills to real-world problems. Now I'm looking forward to using machine learning and data science in environmental science.
