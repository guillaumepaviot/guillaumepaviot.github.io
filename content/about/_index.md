I studied engineering and environmental science at IMT Atlantique in Nantes, France, and computer science at TU Berlin in Germany.

Passionate about both computer science and the environment, I've applied my skills to real-world problems through various side projects, such as developing chatbots and language models. Now, I'm excited to use machine learning and data science in real-life projects.
