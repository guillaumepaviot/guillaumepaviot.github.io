To streamline the process of greeting patients and collecting their basic information for paperwork, I developed a solution for a doctor's office. The goal was to gather patient details and generate referral letters for their primary care physicians efficiently.

**Implementation Details:**

**1. Chatbot Development:**

- Built using Streamlit to ask fixed questions typically required by the doctor, tailored to the patient's appointment reason.
- Utilized an open-source large language model (LLM) to draft referral letters based on the collected information for the doctor's review.
- Created a custom prompt template to tailor the referral letter based on the patient's reason for visiting.

**2. Technology Stack:**

- Employed Ollama and LangChain for the LLM integration.
- Created a small FastAPI API to connect the model with the frontend.

**Current Status and Next Steps:**

- The project is ongoing, with the next phase focused on integrating the chatbot with the existing system.
- Despite being in progress, the doctor is very pleased with the current results.

This project is really important to me as since it's a great use case of how technology can help in daily life. It highlights my ability to develop practical solutions using advanced technologies, improving efficiency in a healthcare setting, and integrating multiple tools and frameworks to create a cohesive system.
