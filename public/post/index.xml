      <description>To streamline the process of greeting patients and collecting their basic information for paperwork, I developed a solution for a doctor&amp;rsquo;s office. The goal was to gather patient details and generate referral letters for their primary care physicians efficiently.
Implementation Details:
1. Chatbot Development:
Built using Streamlit to ask fixed questions typically required by the doctor, tailored to the patient&amp;rsquo;s appointment reason. Utilized an open-source large language model (LLM) to draft referral letters based on the collected information for the doctor&amp;rsquo;s review.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in how machine learning models can read an write text. The objective of this project is to implement various natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and neural networks at a low level using PyTorch, to get a better understanding of their functionality. I trained these algorithms on Les Fleurs du Mal by the French poet Charles Baudelaire because I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of his work and was curious of how models would write poetry.</description>

      <description>As a League of Legend fan, I always wondered who is the best team, and the best player ? And how do they compare to each other across the years and leagues. To answer those questions, I tried different methods.
1. Power Ranking
I first started with a power ranking as they did in Overwatch League by IBM. It was done by engineering features that correlated to winning, and then assigning a weight to each of them, proportional to their correlation.</description>

      <description>During the announcement of an event on Twitch that sparked significant reactions from various communities on Twitter, I scraped approximately 29,000 tweets using the API to learn more about network analysis and using an API.
Key Steps and Achievements:
1. Data Cleaning and Enrichment: I cleaned the data and retrieved missing values from additional endpoints to ensure data integrity for analysis in Gephi. 2. Data Preparation: The cleaned data was organized into two CSV files: one for edges and one for nodes, resulting in 24,000 nodes (Twitter users) and 40,000 edges (interactions between Tweets through by someone).</description>

      <title>Forecasting electric consumption</title>

      <description>This project aimed to explore time series analysis and forecasting using energy consumption data from ENEDIS open data, the French electrical distributor. The dataset includes energy volumes injected, extracted, produced, or consumed in the Enedis network, recorded every half hour.
Key Steps and Achievements:
1. Data Preparation:
-Downloaded JSON data from the ENEDIS API. -Focused on timestamps and total consumption. -Chose JSON for compatibility with the ENEDIS API and future online learning updates.</description>

      <description>This academic group project, conducted for the NGO The Sea Cleaners, was aimed to develop a chatbot to enhance the attractiveness of their FAQ section.
Key Requirements:
-Integratable into a website -Interactive and user-friendly -Readable code and easy-to-use for non-coders
Implementation Details:
-Technology Stack: We used TensorFlow for question analysis and Flask for integration. -Data Management: Themes, questions, and answers are stored in a JSON file. For ease of modification, clients can use an Excel version of the file, which is later converted to JSON.</description>
